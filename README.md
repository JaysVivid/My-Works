# Trip Tracking Star Schema
#### At a very high level, I would consider the following in the design of a dimensional star schema for tracking the trip details.
### 1. Identify the business process we want to track
In the given scenario, the business is interested in tracking the following measures:

•	Daily trips taken

•	Duration of trips

•	Miles driven

### 2. Choose the granularity of the fact data
This will depend on the total volume of transaction-level data. It’s usually a good idea to start with the finest grain of data and store each Trip transaction line item.

### 3. Strip out the dimensions
Identify the attributes involved in each transaction and create separate dimension tables for them. Each record in the dimension table should be unique and have a numeric primary key associated to it. Here Driver, Profile, Vehicle and Calendar (dates) are all dimensions of the Trip tracking.



### 4. Consolidate the facts
The remaining metrics like Trip Count, Trip Distance and Trip are the measures and belong in a fact table. Alongside each measure, we should have foreign keys that reference all dimensions involved in the process like Driver, Profile, Vehicle and Calendar.

So, at the very high level, the following represents the Star schema for this scenario:

### Note:
This data mart can answer questions like:

1. How many trips taken Daily (Trip Count (Set equal to 1) so can be by users)?
2. What is the duration of the Trip taken (calculated as Started_at – Ended_at)?
3. How many miles driven in the given trip?
4. Here, Driver_ID, Vechile_ID and Profile_ID are the Degenerative keys for the respective tables Dim_Driver, Dim_Vehicle and Dim_Profile.
